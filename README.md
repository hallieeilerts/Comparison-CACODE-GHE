# Comparison - CACODE and GHE

Comparison of cause-specific mortality estimates from CA CODE and GHE. See `src` folder for code and `make.R` for how to run analysis. Processed data outputs are located in `gen` folder. 

See `./data/classification-keys/GHE-CACODE-cause-mapping.csv` for mapping of GHE causes to CA CODE causes. Other raw data used in the analysis has not been pushed to github due to size.
